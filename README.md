## Installing this Extension in Chrome and Chromium Browsers


1.  **Download the Extension Files:**
    
    -   Download the extension files from the GitHub repository. This usually involves cloning the repository or downloading a ZIP archive of the files.
        
    -   Extract the files to a folder on your computer. Remember the location of this folder.
        
2.  **Open the Extensions Page:**
    
    -   Open your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
        
    -   In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/` for Microsoft Edge) and press Enter. This will open the browser's extensions management page.
        
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    
    -   On the extensions page, find the "Developer mode" toggle switch, usually located in the top right corner.
        
    -   Toggle it to the "on" position.
        
4.  **Load the Unpacked Extension:**
    
    -   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears at the top left of the page.
        
    -   A file dialog will open. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files in Step 1.
        
    -   Select the folder containing the extension's `manifest.json` file. Click "Select Folder".
        
5.  **Extension Installed:**
    
    -   The extension should now be installed and appear in your browser's extension list.
        

**Important Notes:**

-   **Developer Mode:** Remember to only enable Developer Mode when you need to install or manage unpacked extensions. It's generally a good practice to keep it disabled otherwise.
    
-   **File Location:** Do not delete or move the folder containing the extension files after installation. The extension needs these files to function. If you move or delete them, the extension may stop working, and you may have to reinstall it.
    
-   **Updates:** Unpacked extensions do not automatically update like extensions installed from the Chrome Web Store or the Edge Add-ons store. To update an unpacked extension, you will usually need to download the updated files and repeat the installation process.
    
-   **Manifest File:** The `manifest.json` file is crucial for the extension. It provides the browser with information about the extension, such as its name, version, and permissions. Make sure this file is present in the folder you select.

**Disclaimer:** Installing extensions from outside the official browser extension stores carries some risk, as these extensions have not undergone the same level of scrutiny for security and stability. Only install extensions from sources you trust.
